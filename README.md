1	Introduction

In today's digital era, the notion of a secure corporate network is crucial to the success and integrity of businesses across the globe. As organisations increasingly depend on digital infrastructure, ensuring the safety and security of data becomes a pressing concern. A secure corporate network not only shields sensitive information from external threats but also cultivates trust amongst stakeholders, including customers, partners, and employees. Such a network acts as the foundation, facilitating seamless operations whilst safeguarding intellectual property, financial data, and personal details. Recognising its importance, this document explores the nuances of designing and maintaining a sturdy corporate network, emphasising its pivotal role in contemporary business settings. For this coursework we focus on securing the network for a company called Quantum Byte Dynamics, further details of which are given in the brief section.
